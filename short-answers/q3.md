# Question
Why is event delegation helpful?

# Answer

Event delegation is helpful because it makes sure to isolate a specified role to that child tag. So in the case of pressing a button and only wanting that button to trigger and nothing outside of it, delegation can be used to do so.

Yup! It is also helpful in that you do not need to attach an event listener to every single element, only the parent!
